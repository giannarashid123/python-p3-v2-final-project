# Language Learning CLI App

A simple command-line app for managing users and tracking language learning progress.

This is a simple command-line application that allows users to sign up, log in, update their email, and delete their accounts while tracking language learning progress. The app is built with Python and uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database management along with Alembic to handle database migrations. To get started, clone the repository, create and activate a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`), and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Next, run the database migrations with `alembic upgrade head` to set up the database schema. You can then launch the app by running `python lib/cli.py` and follow the interactive menu prompts to navigate the available options. The project effectively uses lists and dictionaries to manage CLI data, validates user input, and provides clear, user-friendly messages throughout the experience. The codebase is organized to separate core functions from the CLI logic for clarity and maintainability. Overall, this application demonstrates a clean and functional approach to building a Python CLI tool with proper database integration and a smooth user workflow.
